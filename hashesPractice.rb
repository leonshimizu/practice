# Create a banking program that asks the user 5 times to enter a first name, last name, and email. This information should be stored as an array of hashes.
# Each person should automatically be given an account number which is a randomized ten digit number.
# After the user is finished, the program should print out all the users. For example:

users = [
  {
    "first_name" => "",
    "last_name" => "",
    "email" => ""
  },
  {
    "first_name" => "",
    "last_name" => "",
    "email" => ""
  },
  {
    "first_name" => "",
    "last_name" => "",
    "email" => ""
  },
  {
    "first_name" => "",
    "last_name" => "",
    "email" => ""
  },
  {
    "first_name" => "",
    "last_name" => "",
    "email" => ""
  }
]
